kairos-kafka
============

Elastic Search plugin for KairosDB

Currently built against a staging repo for the upcoming KairosDB 0.9.5

Using the Kafka Plugin
----------------------

Because kafka events are just binary blobs this plugin cannot handle all use
cases.  You will need to write your own topic parser but, never fear I think
I've made the process pretty simple.

Do the following:

1. Fork the plugin repo
2. Implement your own TopicParser class.
3. Bind your class in KafkaModule.java
4. Declare your parser in kairos-kafka.properties.

I've implemented a StringTopicParser that assumes each kafka event is a UTF8 string.
Use StringTopicParser as an example of how to implement your own topic parser.


Information about Kairos plugins

Todo Items:
-----------
* Add pre and post install scripts to stop and restart Kairos.
* More unit tests.
